# Crumbs 🥖
A silly location tracker. This is also my first android app 🐷

# What is Crumbs?
A silly location tracker ( ＾▽＾)っ  <br />
In the old tales, bread crumbs were used to mark tracks, hence the name ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

# How do I use Crumbs?
It's stupid simple!  <br />
When you run the app for the first time, it'll tell you your current coordinates  <br /> 
<ul>
<li> <b>Drop Crumb:</b> You can drop crumbs to mark different the different locations you've been at. However, you must click on the update button to see the crumbs count. </li>
<li> <b>Map Crumb:</b> This opens a map and shows you the locations you've dropped crumbs at. However, when you click this button without having dropped crumbs, it'll show you the default location- Sydney </li>
</ul>
